== 8.1 Add dependencies

Ensure `pom.xml` has the following dependencies:

----
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.jetbrains.kotlin</groupId>
            <artifactId>kotlin-test-junit5</artifactId>
            <version>${kotlin.version}</version>
            <scope>test</scope>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
            <artifactId>junit-jupiter</artifactId>
            <version>5.9.3</version>
            <scope>test</scope>
        </dependency>
----

== 8.2 Create a Unit Test
Create Unit test for `Race.start()`:
1. Locate and open `Race.kt`, then right click in the body of `Race` class, select *Generate... > Test ...*:

image::images/GenerateUnitTest.png[generate-unit-test]


Check the setUp and start() checkboxes:

image::images/GenerateTestChoices.png[generate-unit-test-choices]

This will generate a skeleton unit test for the start() function.

We are now going to set up system under test (SUT) by building a race in setUp function. this function runs before every test:

[source,kotlin]
----
@BeforeEach
fun setUp() {
    val teamRedBull = Team(
        "Red Bull",
        listOf(
            Driver("Verstappen"),
            Driver("Perez")
        ),
        setOf(
            RaceCar(
                carNumber = 1,
                numLaps = NUMBER_OF_LAPS,
            ),
            RaceCar(
                carNumber = 11,
                numLaps = NUMBER_OF_LAPS,
            )
        )
    )
    val teamMercedes = Team(
        "Mercedes",
        listOf(
            Driver("Hamilton"),
            Driver("Russell")
        ),
        setOf(
            RaceCar(
                carNumber = 44,
                numLaps = NUMBER_OF_LAPS,
            ),
            RaceCar(
                carNumber = 63,
                numLaps = NUMBER_OF_LAPS,
            )
        )
    )
    race = Race(NUMBER_OF_LAPS, listOf(teamRedBull, teamMercedes))
}
----

Now lets implement a test. In Kotlin you can yous a back tick quotes to make test description more readable. Typically, this is done in a GWT (Given-When-Then) format. In our example let's shorten it to When-Then. In the test , use the `assertEquals` from `kotlin.test` by importing it at the top of the class: `import kotlin.test.assertEquals`. We are going to assert that the race has 4 results, one for each driver, and that current lap is 5 (last lap, that has finished).

[source,kotlin]
----
@Test
fun `When 4 drivers then race should have 4 results after race has run`() {
    race.start()
    assertEquals(4, race.raceResults.size, "Race should have 4 results, one for each driver")
    assertEquals(5, race.currentLap)
}
----

Run the test by clicking on a gree play button inside the test source file ot rightclicking on the file in the project view and selecting *Run RaceTest*.
You should see the following output:

image::images/RunRaceTest.png[run-race-test]

== 8.3 Debug

Let's debug our application while running a unit test. First place a breakpoint inside the `for` loop in the Race.run() function, then right click on test class and select *Debug RaceTest* :

image::images/DebugRace.png[debug-race]

Expand the `this` instance on the right of the debugger. You should see values of all the properties within our race instance. Expand `teams` list, you should see our teams within the race. Keep expanding the object tree, you should see that each driver is assigned a car in the `driverCarMap`.

== 8.4 Update addLapTime
Now it's time to see our test doing regression. First we are going to improve a function in `RaceCar`. There we had a function `addLapTime`:

[source,kotlin]
----
fun addLapTime(lapNumber: Int, time: Double) {
    lapTimes[lapNumber] = time
}
----

As you can see, the function adds a time and uses a lap number as index. Index in an Array start with 0, so our lapNumber parameter start with 0, which is not logical. The program works because we always pass in previous lap number into this function, incrementing the lap afterwards.

Let's improve this function, so we are going to accept the actual current lap number (so starting from 1). This means that we need to decrement lap number before we add result ot our `lapTimes` array:

[source,kotlin]
----
fun addLapTime(lapNumber: Int, time: Double) {
    lapTimes[lapNumber - 1] = time
}
----

As we have not changed the rest of the program, our test should fail now because ther program no longer works properly. Run the RaceTest again and see whether it catches the bug.

You should see that the test has failed with `java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. This is because as part of our change we also need to make sure that the lap number is increased before we add lapTime to the array. Try to find this bug by debugging the program.

TIP: Place a breakpoint where addLapTime function is called and debug when the `currentLap` is being incremented. Fix this bug, and run the test again.

You should now have a passing test.

Add a unit test for RaceCar with the following test: `When lap time is added then it should be in correct position in the lapTimes array`

The solution can be seen in this commit: https://github.com/elenavanengelenmaslova/kotlin-maven-f1-simulator-workshop/commit/6ebf273a2da39bee776cdc0372ea1749f888c620

Let's now add a test for unhappy flow. Remember in the `setUp` function we defined that we have 5 laps, which initialised our `lapTimes` array to 5 elements. We are now going to add a test that asserts that `addLapTime` will throw an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` when we try to add results for lap number 6.

[source,kotlin]
----
@Test
fun `When lap number accedes 5 then throw ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`() {
    assertFailsWith<ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException> {
        car.addLapTime(6, 3.6)
    }
}
----

== 8.5 Mocking with MockK
Mocking is used in testing to isolate unit being tested and mock the dependencies.
Add MockK to `pom.xml`:

----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.mockk</groupId>
    <artifactId>mockk-jvm</artifactId>
    <version>1.13.5</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>slf4j-simple</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.7</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

We are going to test `generateRaceEvent`, but first let's make it more configurable so that we can mock randomness easily. Create the following class in `Race.kt`:

[source,kotlin]
----
class RandomnessProvider {
    fun nextInt(until: Int): Int {
        return Random.nextInt(until)
    }
}
----

Update `generateRaceEvent` to make `RandomnessProvider` injectable though function parameters, and use it instead of Random.nextInt directly:

[source,kotlin]
----
fun generateRaceEvent(
    breakdownPercent: Int = 5,
    collisionPercent: Int = 2,
    randomnessProvider: RandomnessProvider = RandomnessProvider(),
): RaceEvent {
    val totalExceptionPercent = breakdownPercent + collisionPercent
    val event = randomnessProvider.nextInt(100).let {
        when {
            it < breakdownPercent -> RaceEvent.BREAKDOWN
            it < totalExceptionPercent -> RaceEvent.COLLISION
            else -> RaceEvent.NORMAL
        }
    }
    return event
}
----

Now we can add a unit test that mocks `RandomnessProvider` such that we can test all three conditions:
- Breakdown event
- Collision event
- Normal lap event

Right click in the source of `generateRaceEvent`, and check the test class name to GenerateRaceEventTest.

Implement the following test with all three conditions covered:

[source,kotlin]
----
import io.mockk.every
import io.mockk.mockk
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test
import kotlin.test.assertEquals

internal class GenerateRaceEventTest {

    //mock randomness provider with Mockk
    private val mockRandomnessProvider: RandomnessProvider = mockk()

    @Test
    fun `When random event is in first 5% then event value is BREAKDOWN`() {
        //any value  of 0 - 4, we are using 0
        every { mockRandomnessProvider.nextInt(100) } returns 0
        assertEquals(RaceEvent.BREAKDOWN, generateRaceEvent(randomnessProvider = mockRandomnessProvider))
    }

    @Test
    fun `When random event is in the next 2% then event value is COLLISION`() {
        // any value of 5 or 6, we are using 6
        every { mockRandomnessProvider.nextInt(100) } returns 6
        assertEquals(RaceEvent.COLLISION, generateRaceEvent(randomnessProvider = mockRandomnessProvider))
    }

    @Test
    fun `When random event is in the other 93% then event value is NORMAL`() {
        // any value of 7 - 99, we are using 99
        every { mockRandomnessProvider.nextInt(100) } returns 99
        assertEquals(RaceEvent.NORMAL, generateRaceEvent(randomnessProvider = mockRandomnessProvider))
    }
}
----

== 8.6 Test Coverage
Let's now run out tests with Coverage so that we can see which code still needs to be covered by unit tests.

1. Right-click *kotlin* folder inside the *src/test* folder.
2. Select *More Run/Debug > Run 'All Tests' With Coverage* as shown below:

image::images/RunTestsWithCoverage.png[run-coverage]

3. If you get a popup asking about whether to add or replace coverage results, choose replace option.
4. Expand coverage results in the right pane:

image::images/CoverageResults.png[coverage-results]

5. We can see that Race class needs some more work. Double-click on that class in the coverage results pane to see which lines need covering.

image::images/UncoveredLines.png[coverage-results]

== 8.6 Add tests
Lets improve test coverage. It is improtant nt only to just cover the code lines but also to do asserts on the results to insure correct behavior of the code. You do not need to test any code that is generated, e.g. equals, hashcode and toString.

- Remember to use new test for each scenario (GWT - Given-When-Then)
- If a function is private, you can make it `internal` instead so that test class can access it.
- If you are testing a function that prints output, here is an example:

[source,kotlin]
----
    @BeforeEach
    fun `Set up System out`(){
        outContent = ByteArrayOutputStream()
        System.setOut(PrintStream(outContent))
    }

    @Test
    fun `When printing a line "Hello, World! then "Hello, World!\n" is printed on standard out`() {

        println("Hello, World!")

        assertEquals("Hello, World!\n", outContent.toString())
    }

    @AfterEach
    fun `Reset the System out`(){
        System.setOut(System.out)
    }

----

- If you are testing a function (e.g. `main`) that asks for user input, here is an example:

----

----

1. Add a test for `Driver.addPoints` function

2. Improve `RaceTest` by adding more tests for the `Race` class.
